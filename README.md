# Mongory Core

## Testing

This project uses the Unity test framework for unit testing. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Run tests (this will automatically set up the Unity framework):
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

2. If you only want to set up the Unity framework:
   ```bash
   make setup-unity
   ```

## Development

1. Build the core library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Clean build artifacts:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
